# Student's Performance Prediction

This project is a **Machine Learning-based system** designed to predict student performance based on various academic and personal factors. The goal is to assist educators and institutions in identifying students who may need additional support and to gain insights from the data.


# 🔑 Features

- **Predict student performance** based on input data (e.g., attendance, scores, study hours)  
- Uses supervised machine learning models for prediction  
- Clean data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis  
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for clarity and experimentation  


# ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **scikit-learn** — for model building  
- **Pandas / NumPy** — for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — for visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  


# 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gani812/Student-s-Performance-Prediction.git
cd Student-s-Performance-Prediction
```

2️⃣ **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:*
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

3️⃣ **Open the notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then open the notebook file and run the cells.


# 📊 Example Workflow

- Load and clean dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Split dataset into training and testing sets  
- Train ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Evaluate model performance  


# 💡 Future Improvements

- Add more features (e.g., extracurricular activities, parental education)  
- Improve model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning  
- Build a web interface for easy predictions
